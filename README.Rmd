RSoptSC is an R package for SoptSC: performing analysis and prediction on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. SoptSC can infer cell-cell communication between single cells, and completes multiple single-cell analysis tasks from a single coherent framework. This enables the reconstruction of complex lineage relationships alongside prediction of specific feedback or feedforward interactions. 

SoptSC is also available as a MATLAB package [here](https://github.com/wangshuxiong/soptsc).

* Demo SoptSC at [`vignette("Joost_et_al")`](https://mkarikom.github.io/RSoptSC/articles/Joost_et_al.html)

* Read the SoptSC preprint on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/12/168922)


## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("mkarikom/RSoptSC")
```


## Features

* Inference of cell-cell communication between single cells

* Integration of multiple analyses in a consistent mathematical framework: clustering, marker genes, pseudotime, and lineage inference

* Cell-cell similarity matrix construction to improve clustering

* NMF-based marker gene identification

* Prediction of the number of clusters present (via eigengap properties of the similarity matrix)

* Prediction of the initial cell in pseudotime
